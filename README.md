- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Custom bridge networks

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10+)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## üîß Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-microservice.git
cd ecommerce-microservice
```


# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000



### 3. Build and Run with Docker Compose
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build


```

### 4. Access the Application
- **E-commerce Platform**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend product API**: http://localhost:5000/api/products



## üê≥ Docker Architecture

### Base Images

#### Backend (Node.js API)

Base Image: node:18-alpine
Reasoning:

Alpine Linux provides minimal footprint (~5MB base) reducing overall image size
Node.js 18 is the current LTS version ensuring stability and long-term support
Alpine's package manager (apk) allows easy installation of additional tools like curl
Security benefits due to minimal attack surface



#### Frontend (React Application)

Base Image: node:18-alpine (multi-stage build)
Reasoning:

Multi-stage build separates build environment from runtime environment
First stage compiles React application with full development dependencies
Second stage creates minimal production image serving only built static files
Reduces final image size by ~70% compared to single-stage build
Uses serve package for efficient static file serving


## üöÄ Usage

### Adding Products
1. Navigate to the admin dashboard
2. Fill out the product form with:
   - Product name
   - Description
   - Price
  
3. Click "Add Product" to save

- NB:  Add product and reload page (this is caused by improper update of state management however not the goalfor the challenge which is strictly practicing on Docker)


## üìä API Endpoints

### Product Management
```
GET    /api/products          # Get all products
POST   /api/products          # Create new product

```


### Docker Compose 
Create `docker-compose.yml` for local customizations:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web-app:
    environment:
      - DEBUG=true
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src:ro
```
